## Tell a serf agent to join a node on start

Using serf [config file](http://www.serfdom.io/docs/agent/options.html) `-config-file` you can indicate to your starting serf agent to join a specific node.

`"start_join":["node2_host"],`

You even can indicate multiple nodes :

`"start_join":["node2_host","node3_host"]`


If *node2_host* and *node3_host* are not available, your agent will terminate.

## Keep agent alive, even if joinning nodes failed.

Just add _localhost_ (your agent bind iface) to the list of node to join on start.

`"start_join":["node2_host","node3_host","localhost"]`
